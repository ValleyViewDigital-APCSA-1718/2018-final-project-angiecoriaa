For my game I created a different version of the game space intrudes, it had all similar features but it’s a different. In the 
game there is no time limit but there is limited amount of lives, each time you only get 3 lives before you lose. The purpose of 
the game is meant to pop all of the balloons before they attack you and you lose all of your lives. You simply start the game by 
moving left and right, you also shoot with the space bar at that same times the balloons will be moving and attacking you. Each 
time that the balloon gets to the edge of the screen they will lower a level. If all the balloons don’t get destroyed then, you
will be killed another way that you can also hey killed is when the balloons fires back if the firearm touch you will lose a life.
If it continues to touch you then  you will lose all of your life’s and on the screen Game Over will pop up on the screen. 




Instructions
Left key arrow = move the rocket left
Right key arrow = move the recket right
Space bar = shoot the missile
